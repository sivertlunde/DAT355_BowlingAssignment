# DAT355_BowlingAssignment

I'm afraid I didn't quite understand what was meant by "how to use the delivery". 
I have followed the tutorial and started the "Bowling_model_Sivert" as an Eclipse Application. There I was able to create entities of the models, but these were stored in a seperate directory.

all Bowling_model... directories

# Usage & EMF Forms

I had trouble launching the RAP application. When i right clicked the .launch file and selected run as RAP application, it triggered the editor program Atom every time. It never opened a browser and I was unable to find the content on the same URL pictured in the tutorial.
