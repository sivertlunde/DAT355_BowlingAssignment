# DAT355_BowlingAssignment

I'm afraid I didn't quite understand what was meant by "how to use the delivery". 
I have followed the tutorial and started the "Bowling_model_Sivert" as an Eclipse Application. There I was able to create entities of the models, but these were stored in a seperate directory.
